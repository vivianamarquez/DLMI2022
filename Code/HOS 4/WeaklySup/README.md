# Summer School on Deep Learning for Medical Imaging (2022) - 3rd Edition
## Hands-on tutorial on Weakly Supervised Image Segmentation for Medical Images. 

This repository contains the code of the hands-on tutorial on Weakley Supervised Image Segmentation. It covers the following topics:
* **naive sizeloss** + **toy dataset**, to demonstrate the functionality of size loss and the general aspect of the code;
* **naive sizeloss** + **log-barrier extension**, using a second toy dataset to show the usage of penalty functions for weakly supervised learning;
* **naive sizeloss** + **ACDC dataset**, to apply the sizeloss for a real case of medical imaging segmentation.
